Give the UITabBarController a third tab that presents a quiz to the user. (Hint: you can reuse files from your Quiz project for this challenge.)

Add a UISegmentedControl to BNRHypnosisViewController’s view with segments for Red, Green, and Blue. When the user taps the segmented control, change the color of the circles in BNRHypnosisView. Be sure to create a copy of the project and work from that copy while attempting this challenge.”
